# MesiSols ☀️
MesiSols is a collection of generative pixel art NFTs on the Algorand Blockchain. MesiSol generation is decided partly complete randomization and partly logic. Through statistical distribution, star attributes were made to be balanced, cohesive, and varied. Some attributes are not shown in the actual NFT image itself but as one of the NFT's attributes. These properties are normally used to help generate the visual properties of a MesiSol.

Mesisols are not given a predefined rarity. The vision was for each MesiSol to have ambiguous value. Rarity scores will still be given through ARC69 and more information about MesiSol attributes can be found on our website linked below.

# Introduction
The MesiSols program is broken into several sections:

Generator: contains the python files for the computation and generation of a single MesiSol
Data Sets: contains some CSV files that I used to ensure that the distribution of the numbers is standardized
Image Maker: contains the python files for the generation of the image of a MesiSol
Json Attributes: contains the python files for generating the metadata of each NFT so that the attributes can be displayed on
                 sites like RandGallery or NFTExplorer.
Minting: contains the python files for minting each mesisol on the blockchain automatically.

With all files installed, you should be able to run the commands in main.py to deploy full functionality of the program.

Thanks for checking out MesiSols and stay tuned for more Mesiverse releases!
